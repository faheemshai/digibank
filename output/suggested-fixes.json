      "root_cause": "The test failure occurs because the `positiveResultTest` method expects 2 ATM locations to be returned, but the current implementation returns 0. This is due to a logic error in the `SearchService.java` file where the condition `if (count > 2)` prevents the code from processing and returning the expected 2 ATM locations.",
      "verification": "To verify the fix, run the `positiveResultTest` method in the `AtmLocationSearchTest` class. The test should now pass as it will receive the expected 2 ATM locations. **Additional Note:** The fix changes the condition from `count > 2` to `count > 0`, which allows the code to process and return ATM locations when there is at least one location available. This aligns with the test's expectation of receiving 2 ATM locations."
